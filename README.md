## 📖 The Story Behind FieldNote

As a product researcher conducting continuous user interviews, I constantly found myself drowning in scattered Google Docs, disjointed Notion pages, and messy spreadsheets. **I needed a way to capture qualitative insights that felt as structured as quantitative data.**

The problem with most "research repositories" is that they are bloated, require cloud subscriptions, or feel like overwhelming databases. I wanted a tool that felt like a **disciplined researcher's notebook**—calm, structured, and fast.

I built **FieldNote** to solve this. It's an offline-first, privacy-focused application that allows researchers to define standard question structures, tag friction points in real-time, and automatically generate pattern insights across all participants in a project.

## ✨ Core Features

*   **🗂️ Project-Based Scoping:** Organize your research into dedicated projects. Every interview belongs to a clear contextual scope.
*   **🏗️ Custom Interview Structures:** Don't start from scratch every time. Define a standard flow (e.g., Context → Decisions → Friction → Impact) and apply it to all interviews.
*   **🏷️ Generic Tagging Engine:** Uncover patterns fast. Tag notes with categories like `Behaviour`, `Motivation`, `Friction`, and `Impact`.
*   **📊 Instant Insights Dashboard:** FieldNote automatically aggregates your tags and stress scores to show you exactly where users are struggling across a project.
*   **🔒 Privacy-First & Offline:** Entirely built on local storage. No databases, no subscriptions, no cloud leaks. Your data stays on your machine until you export it.
*   **📤 Exportable Summaries:** Generate instant qualitative summaries for stakeholders in JSON or clean Text format.
